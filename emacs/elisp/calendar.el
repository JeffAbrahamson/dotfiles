Newsgroups: comp.emacs,gnu.emacs.sources

I posted this to comp.emacs a little over a week ago.  Either it failed to
make it off of my local news server, or everyone who has commented on previous
versions was reading gnu.emacs.sources, because I received no comments, in
spite of the fact that I have fixed some bugs that were annoying a couple of
people.  So once again, here is version 0.4.

-----

I've made some additional enhancements and bug fixes to my desk calendar
display code.  Most of these are in response to bug reports and requests for
new features.  In no particular order (okay, in the order I implemented them),
here are the changes:

1) Setting diary-duplicate-time-display to nil will cause suppression of
   duplicate times appearing in the output.  For example,

		%%(diary-today)
			12pm 1st event
		     	12pm 2nd event
		     	12pm 3rd event
			12pm 4th event

   in your diary file will produce

		12:00 | 1st event
		      | 2nd event
		      | 3rd event
		      | 4th event
		  :30 

   instead of

		12:00 | 1st event
		  :00 | 2nd event
		  :00 | 3rd event
		  :00 | 4th event
		  :30 

2) Setting diary-schedule-odd-times-get-separate-entry to a non-nil value will
   cause appointments that start at a time other than an interval boundary to
   get a line of their own in the calendar.  For example,

		 6:00 
		  :12 | Sunrise 6:12am (Eastern Daylight Time) at Rochester, NY (13:53 hours daylight)
		  :30 

3) Setting diary-schedule-first-time-always-has-hours will cause the time for
   the first interval of the day to be printed with the hour regardless of
   whether it falls on an hour boundary.

4) Wrote a quick hack to break long lines.  There is a variable for setting
   the fill-prefix for the continued lines.

;; Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.

;; To Do:
;;
;; 1) Rewrite display engine into two separate passes.  The first builds a sorted list
;;    of appointments and the second displays it in the preferred style.  This will
;;    allow the first pass to be used for various different displays, including
;;    generation of LaTeX source for various formats.
;; 2) Write some comments describing some of the obscure portions, if they survive the
;;    rewrite.
;; 3) Add a variable to specify the increments in which the grid will be extended
;;    instead of simply using diary-schedule-interval-time.  That would allow, for
;;    example, an interval of 30 minutes, but extending the calendar in increments of
;;    an hour.
;; 4) Add some functions that directly implement some of the recurring event options
;;    described in RFC 2446 (especially section 4.8.5.4).  All of these can be
;;    constructed with sexp entries, but some of the code gets a bit hairy to embed
;;    in the diary file for each entry.  It seems better to have a library of
;;    functions like the ones that are still tagging along at the end of this file.
;; 5) Implement handling of multiple timezones explicitly.  The real problem is when
;;    the calendar dates for a particular moment in time differ between the zones.
;;    This will probably require grabbing the events for the previous and following
;;    dates and checking their times after the TZ calculations.
