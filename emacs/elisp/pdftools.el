;;; COMMENTARY: In a civilized world, you wouldn't need this, but the
;;; world is not civlized.

;;; SETUP: (load "pdftools")

;;; USAGE: All of the functions here use ps-spool- functions and then
;; call ps2pdf to generate the pdf file.  If no prefix arg is given,
;; the pdf file will be opened.  With a prefix, the file is saved but
;; not opened.
;;
;; If no filename is given, then the current buffer name is used, with
;; ".pdf" appended
;;
;; If the output is not to your liking, customize variables in the ps
;; group.

;;; CODE:

;(defun pdf-debug (quiet filename)
;  "debugger for pdftools"
;  (interactive "P\nGFile name: ")
;  (if (file-directory-p filename)
;      (setq filename (concat (buffer-name) ".pdf")))
;  (print filename)
